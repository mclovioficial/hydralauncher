## Build From Source

### Install Node.js

Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If not, download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Environment Variables

You'll need an SteamGridDB API Key in order to fetch the game icons on installation.
If you want to have onlinefix as a repacker you'll need to add your credentials to the .env

Once you have it, you can copy or rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`and put it on`STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY`, `ONLINEFIX_USERNAME`, `ONLINEFIX_PASSWORD`.
